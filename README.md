# Advent of Code solutions in Go

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) written in
Go. Each year is kept in a separate folder, where days are grouped into folders.
Things that are shared between days are placed inside the _internal_ directory.

The repository is based on this template: <https://github.com/chwallen/go-aoc-template>.

Go 1.25 or later is required.
